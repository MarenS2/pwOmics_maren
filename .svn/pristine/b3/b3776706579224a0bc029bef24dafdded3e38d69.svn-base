containing gene/transcript data. Each of the sublists has a first element 
with all measured protein/gene IDs and a second element with a list of the 
length of the number of measured time points. Each of these lists contains 
a dataframe with a first column of significant protein/gene IDs at that time 
point and a second column with the corresponding logFCs.}

\description{
A dataset as input example for readOmics: A list containing two input lists,
