	abstract = {Cells respond to stimuli by changes in various processes, including signaling pathways and gene expression. Efforts to identify components of these responses increasingly depend on {mRNA} profiling and genetic library screens. By comparing the results of these two assays across various stimuli, we found that genetic screens tend to identify response regulators, whereas {mRNA} profiling frequently detects metabolic responses. We developed an integrative approach that bridges the gap between these data using known molecular interactions, thus highlighting major response pathways. We used this approach to reveal cellular pathways responding to the toxicity of alpha-synuclein, a protein implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease. For this we screened an established yeast model to identify genes that when overexpressed alter alpha-synuclein toxicity. Bridging these data and data from {mRNA} profiling provided functional explanations for many of these genes and identified previously unknown relations between alpha-synuclein toxicity and basic cellular pathways.},

Recent extensions of our data model accommodate the annotation of cancer and other disease processes. First, we have extended our class of protein modifications to accommodate annotation of changes in amino acid sequence and the formation of fusion proteins to describe the proteins involved in disease processes. Second, we have added a disease attribute to reaction, pathway, and physical entity classes that uses disease ontology terms. To support the graphical representation of "cancer" pathways, we have adapted our Pathway Browser to display disease variants and events in a way that allows comparison with the wild type pathway, and shows connections between perturbations in cancer and other biological pathways. The curation of pathways associated with cancer, coupled with our efforts to create other disease-specific pathways, will interoperate with our existing pathway and network analysis tools. Using the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ({EGFR}) signaling pathway as an example, we show how Reactome annotates and presents the altered biological behavior of {EGFR} variants due to their altered kinase and ligand-binding properties, and the mode of action and specificity of anti-cancer therapeutics.},

The link from genomes to pathways is made through the {KEGG} Orthology system, a collection of manually defined ortholog groups identified by K numbers. To better automate this interpretation process the {KEGG} modules defined by Boolean expressions of K numbers have been expanded and improved. Once genes in a genome are annotated with K numbers, the {KEGG} modules can be computationally evaluated revealing metabolic capacities and other phenotypic features. The reaction modules, which represent chemical units of reactions, have been used to analyze design principles of metabolic networks and also to improve the definition of K numbers and associated annotations. For translational bioinformatics, the {KEGG} {MEDICUS} resource has been developed by integrating drug labels (package inserts) used in society.},

Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The {STRING} database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {\textgreater}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of {STRING}, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Experiments such as {ChIP}-chip, {ChIP}-seq, {ChIP}-{PET} and {DamID} (the four methods referred herein as {ChIP}-X) are used to profile the binding of transcription factors to {DNA} at a genome-wide scale. Such experiments provide hundreds to thousands of potential binding sites for a given transcription factor in proximity to gene coding regions.
{RESULTS}: In order to integrate data from such studies and utilize it for further biological discovery, we collected interactions from such experiments to construct a mammalian {ChIP}-X database. The database contains 189,933 interactions, manually extracted from 87 publications, describing the binding of 92 transcription factors to 31,932 target genes. We used the database to analyze {mRNA} expression data where we perform gene-list enrichment analysis using the {ChIP}-X database as the prior biological knowledge gene-list library. The system is delivered as a web-based interactive application called {ChIP} Enrichment Analysis ({ChEA}). With {ChEA}, users can input lists of mammalian gene symbols for which the program computes over-representation of transcription factor targets from the {ChIP}-X database. The {ChEA} database allowed us to reconstruct an initial network of transcription factors connected based on shared overlapping targets and binding site proximity. To demonstrate the utility of {ChEA} we present three case studies. We show how by combining the Connectivity Map ({CMAP}) with {ChEA}, we can rank pairs of compounds to be used to target specific transcription factor activity in cancer cells.

	abstract = {Motivation: Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster structures in high-dimensional datasets, such as those obtained in {DNA} microarray and quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main limitations is the lack of a computationally fast method to set optimal values of algorithm parameters. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data. The optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not yield any results for a purely random dataset but which detects cluster formation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness.
Results: Estimation of the optimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the clustering procedure applied to randomized datasets. In this case, the optimal value of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main properties of the dataset. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of objects as input values instead of evaluating the entire dataset allows us to propose a functional relationship determining the fuzzifier directly. This result speaks strongly against using a predefined fuzzifier as typically done in many previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation of the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.
