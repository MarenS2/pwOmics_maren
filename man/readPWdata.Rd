\title{Read in pathway database data needed for pathway identification.}
\usage{
readPWdata(data_omics, loadgenelists, biopax_level = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_omics}{OmicsData object.}

\item{loadgenelists}{path of genelist RData files stored previously; all 
genelists stored in this path are read in and used automatically if path is 
given; if loadgenelists = FALSE, then genelists from pathway databases have 
to be generated first.}

\item{biopax_level}{integer indicating biopax level of pathway database
information. default level is 2.}
}
\value{
list of OmicsData object and genelists for selected pathway databases.
}
\description{
This function reads pathway data of the chosen database(s) via the 
AnnotationHub [1] package and rBiopaxParser [2] package. 
Takes a lot of time for a high number of proteins and/or if all databases 
are chosen.
First, chosen databases are retrieved, then new internal pathway IDs are 
generated. Afterwards the genelists of the different databases are loaded or
generated, depending on the loadgenelists option. Pathway ID mapping takes 
some time, especially for such big databases as reactome, so the genelists 
are automatically stored in the current working folder and can be used 
via loadgenelists in case you use this function again for easier and faster 
usage...
Biopax level of retrieved databases is 2 by default.
